Welcome to my GitHub!
Here I will showcase personal projects where I do proof of concept and apply new technologies I may be curious about
# Virtualization Lab
	In my virtualization lab I use 3 Intel NUC's clustered together using a Netgear managed switch, GLI.NET router and a Zyxel firewall
   # Hardware
     Within the NUC's I have 2 Intel Core i7's (i7-8559U CPU @ 2.70GHz & i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz) and 1 Intel Core i5 (i5-7260U CPU @ 2.20GHz)
     Pictured below are the Intel NUC's used within my lab. They are 7th and 8th generation that total in 128gb of RAM and 3.5TB of SSD Storage
