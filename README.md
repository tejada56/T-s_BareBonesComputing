Welcome to my GitHub! Here I  showcase personal projects where I do proof of concept and apply new technologies I may be curious about
# <h2>Virtualization Lab
Going into the planning for this lab I wanted to find devices that were relatively small, versatile, energy efficient and didnt require a lot of space.
Having researched a variety of computer and network devices that would be able to handle a lab of this size I had in mind, I decided on using Intel BareBones NUC's, a Netgear managed switch, GLI.NET router and a Zyxel firewall.
## <h3>Hardware
* Intel NUC's
  *  The NUC's having many generations and configurations over the last few years, I went for the 7th and 8th generation. Each one being capable of 32gb of RAM, an M.2 SSD Slot, available with multiple processors (i3, i5, i7) and a 2.5 SSD/HDD Bay.
* Below you will find a picture and specifications of 3 NUC's I will be using to carry throughout my lab

 * NUC7i5BNH
   *  Processor:  i5-7260U CPU @ 2.20GHz
   *  RAM: 32gb
   *  Storage: 500gb M2 SSD & 1TB HDD
  
 * NUC8i7BEH
   *  Processor:  i7-8559U CPU @ 2.70GHz
   *  RAM: 64gb 
   *  Storage:  500gb M2 SSD & 500 SSD Sata
  
 * NUC7i7DNHE
   *  Processor:  i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz
   *  RAM: 32gb
   *  Storage:  500gb M2 SSD & 500 SSD Sata

    ##  <h5> Reading multiple articles online, I found come claiming the 8th generation NUC's actually support 64gb of RAM instead of the advertised 32gb. I decided to test this out and astoundigly found this to be true. RAM being the most utilized resource in most of the computing world, next to storage and lastly CPU. I was happy to find this out. Below is a list of the articles I came upon through google.
