# <h1>T-s_BareBonesComputing
Welcome to my GitHub! Here I  showcase personal projects where I do proof of concept and apply new technologies I may be curious about
# <h2>Virtualization Lab
Going into the planning for this lab I wanted to find devices that were relatively small, versatile, energy efficient and didnt require a lot of space.
Having researched a variety of computer and network devices that would be able to handle a lab of this size I had in mind, I decided on using Intel BareBones NUC's, a Netgear managed switch, GLI.NET router and a Zyxel firewall.
## <h3>Hardware
Within the NUC's I have 2 Intel Core i7's (i7-8559U CPU @ 2.70GHz & i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz) and 1 Intel Core i5 (i5-7260U CPU @ 2.20GHz)
Pictured below are the Intel NUC's used within my lab. They are 7th and 8th generation that total in 128gb of RAM and 3.5TB of SSD Storage
