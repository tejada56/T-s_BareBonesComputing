<h1>Security Information Event Management (SIEM)</h1>
<p>Information Systems utilized to store, retrieve and analyze system logs for security incidents/events.</p>
<h2>SIEM's are vital to the security of organizations to monitor and manage expectations of Security incidents/response.</h2>
<p>With more companies migrating to the cloud integrating hybrid envirements and the wide adoption of the Cloud more and more security solutions have been prominent on being based in the cloud.</p>
<p>This wide adoption allows more organizations and companies to adopt secure measures at lower cost, lower investment, less resources, less maintenance and more rapidly deployable environments.</p>
<p>Traditional SIEM's require signigicant resources on infrastructure like CPU, RAM, Storage for SIEM servers, databases, secured networking such as IPSEC tunnels for logs to be forwarded.</p>
<p>Implementation of Cloud SIEM's alleviates the necessity of such infrastructure and development efforts where instead of allocating time to implementation of resources needed by traditional SIEMs, with Cloud SIEMs time allocation would be more importantly put to development of the Security solution rather than the configuration of resources.</p>
