<h1>NUCs</h1>
<p>Next Unit of Computing (NUCs) are small form factor computers that can be utilized as Desktops and Servers. Very affordable and configurable to favor CPU, RAM or Storage.
  
For this lab build I've added some Intel NUCs with an i5 and i7 CPU along with some Miniforums in an i9 and amd Ryzen CPU architecture to provide complexity in functinality.

VMWare products are typically built with support for industry standard servers such Dell, HP, Lenovo, SuperMicro, etc.

NUCs sometimes require additional configuration or specific product version/custom images with drivers for the hardware to function.

You can read more about this online or in the Intel NUCs and Miniforums readme.</p>
