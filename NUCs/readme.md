<h1>NUCs</h1>
<p>Next Unit of Computing (NUCs) are small form factor computers that can be utilized as Desktops and Servers. Very affordable and configurable to favor CPU, RAM or Storage. For this lab build I've added some Intel NUCs with an i5 and i7 CPU along with some Miniforums in an i9 and amd Ryzen CPU architecture to provide complexity in functinality.</p>
