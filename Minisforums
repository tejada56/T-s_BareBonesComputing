Here's more descriptive information on Minisforums and configurations!

## Minisforums!

With Technology advancing, mini computers getting more compact and cheaper decided to add a few Minisforum PC's that have more advanced processors.

Since the maneufactor and processor is different from Intel PC's there's a few compatibility issues for VMWare to be compatible.

Newer processors include efficiency and performance cores that through AI the processor is able to improve its processing power.

An issue with the different processors is the Virtualization of VMWare segments the the processors evenly and as the processors typically have uneven amount of cores between efficiency and performance numerous erros occur for VMWare to run.

For the Minisforum to be compatible with VMWare the efficiency or performance cores need to be turned off.

Additionally setting the efficiency and performance cores to the same amount might enable VMWWare compatibility but limit the amount of performance cores, this can be tested to ensure functionality as the error given is a mismatch of processors.

Another issue is network compatibility as the Network Interface Card drivers aren't natively integrated to the VMWare ESXI OS, this has to be intregated to create a custom ISO.

This process requires adding the NIC drivers to the VMWare ESXI ISO or add a network card through a USB cable.
